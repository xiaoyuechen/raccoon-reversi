{- Game Logic
   The game state consists of a board and a player.
   The board's data structure is a list of cells.
   A cell has an index to identify itself and a state to show ownership
   Everytime when a move is given, makeMove is called. It takes the original board,
   the move, and the player who made the move and returns the new board.

   AI
   The AI fist scan the board to see what options it has.
   This is done by scanning towards 8 directions of every cell it owns.
   After options are known, a minMax algorithm with a depth limit is used to decide the best option.
   In the minMax algorithm, an evaluation algorithm first calculates the "nice value" of each cell,
   them sum them up for the board value. The other heristic the board value considers is the number
   of moves the opponent has, it is multiplied by a negative coefficient. The board value is used by minMax.
   The AI call makeMove to update the board with the best option given by minMax.
